As a user, I can visit a landing page at localhost:3000 that has links to other pages named:

<!-- cubed -->
<!-- evenly -->
<!-- palindrome -->
<!-- madlib -->

<!-- As a user, I can visit a page called cubed that takes a number as a param and displays that number cubed. -->

<!-- As a user, I can visit a page called evenly that takes two numbers and displays whether or not the first number is evenly divisible by the second. -->

<!-- As a user, I can visit a page called palindrome that takes a string and displays whether it is a palindrome (the same word read forward and backward). -->

<!-- As a user, I can visit a page called madlib that takes params of a noun, verb, adjective, adverb, and displays a short silly story. -->
